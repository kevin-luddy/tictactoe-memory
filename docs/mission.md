# Mission - TicTacToe Memory Challenge

## Vision
Create an engaging, kid-friendly Tic-Tac-Toe game that combines classic gameplay with a memory training twist. When it's the player's turn, a visible countdown timer runs, and when it reaches zero, all the pieces on the board become invisible. The player must rely on their memory of piece positions to make strategic moves.

This game transforms a simple tic-tac-toe match into an exciting memory challenge that exercises cognitive skills while providing entertainment. The difficulty system allows players to gradually increase the challenge as their memory improves, with countdown times ranging from a generous 10 seconds (easy) down to an intense 1 second (hard).

Fun, kid-appropriate sound effects accompany every action - playful sounds for placing pieces, exciting fanfares for wins, and encouraging sounds even for losses. A win streak counter motivates players to maintain focus and build their consecutive wins.

## Success Criteria
1. Player can play a complete game of tic-tac-toe against the computer
2. Countdown timer is visible and causes board to go invisible when it ends
3. Difficulty setting changes countdown duration (10s/5s/1s)
4. Win streak tracks consecutive victories
5. Fun sounds play on moves, wins, losses, and countdown events

## In Scope
- 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay vs computer AI
- Visual countdown timer during player's turn
- Board transparency effect when countdown ends
- Three difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Win streak counter with best streak tracking
- Kid-friendly sound effects
- Large, colorful web interface

## Out of Scope
- Multiplayer (two humans)
- Mobile app version
- User accounts/persistence
- Leaderboards
- Complex AI strategies (simple blocking AI is sufficient)

## App Name Rationale
**Chosen Name**: TicTacToe Memory Challenge (or "MemoryTac")
**Reasoning**: The name combines the classic game (TicTacToe) with the unique twist (Memory Challenge), immediately communicating the game's core concept. "MemoryTac" provides a fun, catchy alternative for branding.
