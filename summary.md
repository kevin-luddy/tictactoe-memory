# BDD Project Initialized - TicTacToe Memory Challenge

## Generated Structure
- BDD framework configured (behave)
- Domain model defined (docs/ddd.md)
- State flow mapped (docs/state-diagram.md)
- Mission clarified (docs/mission.md)
- Features created (features/gameplay.feature)
- Architecture planned (pseudocode/*.pseudo)

## Quick Start
1. Review the generated documents in docs/
2. Examine the features/ directory
3. Check pseudocode/ for the planned architecture

## Next Steps
Run the bddwarp command to:
- Generate step definitions
- Implement the pseudocode as real code
- Make all tests pass

## Configuration
- Tech Stack: Python + FastAPI
- BDD Framework: behave
- App Goal: "build a tic-tac-toe game with a memory challenge where during the user's turn a visible countdown shows from 10 seconds (configurable by difficulty from 10s to 1s) and when countdown ends the board pieces become transparent/invisible forcing the user to remember positions; board becomes visible again after user makes their move; includes win streak counter and fun kid-friendly sounds"

## Key Features
- **Memory Challenge**: Board goes invisible after countdown
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy (10s), Medium (5s), Hard (1s)
- **Win Streak**: Tracks consecutive victories
- **Kid-Friendly Sounds**: Fun audio feedback for all actions
- **Large Web UI**: Colorful, engaging interface
